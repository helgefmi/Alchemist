Alchemist
=========

An Elder Scrolls Online addon for alchemists!

What does it do?
----------------

This addon tells you which alchemy reagents (in your current inventory/bank) to combine, and in what order, to get the maximum number of new traits.

If there's no unknown traits available to be discovered, it will tell you that as well.

How does it work?
-----------------

The addon will activate as soon as you interact (click on) an Alchemy Station. When you do that, an extra window will open up with a list of optimal reagent combinations, in order.

TODO / ideas
------------

- It would be nice if you could tell it what types of potions you are interested in creating, in a prioritized list, and let the mod see what's available and not.

- Prettier UI. Show reagent and trait icons, hover effect tooltip, use table instead of list.

- Make it possible to click on the Alchemist window to automatically craft the selected item.

- Support for 3 reagent combinations (for the "Laboratory Use" alchemy passive)
